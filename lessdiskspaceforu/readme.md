#Less Disk Space For U

This program basically makes a very very very big file on your computer very quick
in only a few seconds the program would generate a file of 5gb or more.



***Warning
Don't forget to stop program before you leave. It could do some damage to your system (:

I put the exe for you to try, if it gives you an error telling you that it's mising a dll you can go to
https://www.dll-files.com/. There you can find the missing dll file.





#Compile and run Source Code

if you want to compile the source code open your command prompt(windows) or termainl(linux) and type in:
g++ -o main main.cpp
then to run it on windows wither type in main or main.exe
for linux type in ./main


Hope you enjoy
